#Intro -- Korean Web App
Evenrytime I was commuting, either on bus or train, I always want to take some time to review and practice what I have learnt so far, so a idea came into my mind "why not make a web app so I can do it any where", this is how my Korean Web App come from.

By now, the current version is more like prototyping, it shows the feature to review vocabulary and check the answer, like a simple tool can give yourself a quiz whenever you want.

For next couple of phases, I am going to make it to have stronger foundation. In programming level, it aims to be more testable, scalable, and maintainable. For user experience, I want it progressively to be more flexible, more features, and even customizable.

##Phase 1 - Style
Implement `style in js` in a proper way, currently I am using pure CSS to edit the style of whole App, which is not maintainable for developing.

##Phase 2 - Test
Implement proper ReactJS testing tool.

##Phase 3 - Call API
Build a simple API and API calling function, which will return data to let user review the content.
